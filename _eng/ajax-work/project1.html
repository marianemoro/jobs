              <h4>Leroy Merlin Brazil - E-commerce</h4>
              <p>Leroy Merlin is a big retail company for house and construction. The company has 42 physical stores in Brazil and one e-commerce with its own products and a marketplace's products. The e-commerce team works with Agil method, so every week we have something new.</p>
              <p>As long as I was evolving my work, I started to be responsible for the whole buy flow, which starts at the product page, where the customer add to cart and then goes to cart page, checkout and order tracking.</p>
              <p>My first project was the product page, and this project I had the opportunity to be closer to the stakeholders from differents areas like commercial, content, SEO, developers and marketplace team. They helped me to build a new product page with strategic information for the customer. The newest version is a modular page, where we can change some content position when it's needed. We've done some user tests for the new features and make sure we were on the right way.</p>
              <p>The second projet was a omnichannel order tracking, with this feature the customer can check the order status from the physical store and the e-commerce. With this project we decreased the customer's phone calls to ask about the order status and they could see it at this page. We've done follow up with the Customer Success area to check which new feature could be better to implement next.</p>
              <p>The third project was the hybrid ckeckout, we have 2 order types: deliver and pick up. Because of some technical limitations, our cart supported only one order type at a time, and we started to mesure some customers behaviors and we decided to do this big change and have a better buy experience. So we are going to have a cart that supports all order types together and the customers will have flexibility to pick up in different stores if they want. For this project we had to involve different departments in the company to change some business rules and make it happen and we had to do user tests to check some hypotheses, because this change is huge and we don't have any solution like this in Brazil.</p>
              <p>The fourth project was the new home, this project was a collective UX solution, because we've done some workshops with the areas to have new ideas and validate our solution. Our new home is a modular page and the business area has freedom to change the element positions as a strategy.</p>
