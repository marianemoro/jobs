            </div>
            <p>For every new feature, we started with a value proposition design canvas and we're working with Agile Method to develop the application.</p>
            <p>The value proposition canvas helped us to understand the user's tasks, pains and what they seen as a gain, it's a good interview tool guide when you have a new system to create.</p>

            </div>
            <p>At this time the employees had to do the bank consolidation and then send to the supplier, but they had a lot of other tasks to do and then they kept their jobs always late. They had so many jobs that they need a person just to answer the emails.</p>
            <p>After to understrand this scenario, I started to design a user flow for this solution, I tested the paper prototype with our keyuser to understand what could be improved, what was missing in the interface as soon as possible to create a more consistent high fidelity prototype.</p>

              <h3>Order schedule module</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The second module was the order schedule on the warehouses and stores. The company hasn't a system to schedule the orders from the suppliers and they needed like 5 days to do this for each supplier, they didn't have the visibility of which order was about to come or was late, the suppliers didn't have a system access to schedule their delivery orders and the employees has several problems with productivity.</p>
            <p>We learned about those problems through the Value Proposition Canvas.</p>

            <p>For this module I've done a user flow and a wireframe to test some interactions and the interface with the employees, as I tested, I realized how complex was this module, with so many business rules for different scenarios like one for store and other for warehouses and the system that I was designing had to support all those needs.</p>
            <p>With the new solution the supplier can schedule in about 2 or 3 minutes without any help from the company and the employees can spend their time with other tasks.</p></p>

              <li>The employees have more time to work on their projects and tasks.</li>
              <li>They have more autonomy.</li>
              <li>We decreased the late order's issues.</li>
              <li>The Supply Chain team is happier, because they don't need to do overtime work everyday anymore.</li>

              <h2>Learnings</h2>
              <p>This project was my first with supply chain and the financial departments.</p>
            </div>
            <p>I've never worked with a supply chain project before, so I had to learn a lot about logistics and their business rules. I had to learn about the suppliers reality and their pains too. Learned about when a big company doesn't have a good solution to work with the suppliers and what kind of problem the final custmer can have, like a lack of products to buy.</p>
            <p>Today this project is a profit application with a lot of other modules.</p>
