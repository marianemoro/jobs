              <h4>Leroy Merlin Brazil - Suppliers Portal</h4>
              <p>This project was created to have a better relationship between the company and the suppliers, increase the productivity, improve some process and avoid several order problems.</p>
              <p>This project is in Agil method and we started from the essencial features: financial and order schedule. Today this project it's a profit project, because the suppliers can pay to have different features than the basic version.</p>
              <p>The order schedule is part of the Portal and solves a huge company problem about the orders from the suppliers to the stores and warehouses. Before the suppliers needed about 5 days to schedule a order delivery because they used e-mails, phone calls and spread sheet to control the orders and the data. With this feature we could automate some tasks like check if the order is scheduled on the right place and on the right day and save at the SAP system. Today they new a couple of minutes to schedule a order and the internal team can spend the time working on other tasks and solving more important problems.</p>
              <p>For every new feature, we've done the design thinking workshops with the keyusers and some suppliers, to uderstands their pains, tasks and their dreams. We've done usability tests with those people, to check the userflow and the interface before to develop.</p>
