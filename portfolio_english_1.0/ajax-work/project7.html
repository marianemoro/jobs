              <p>This training is aimed at welcoming new employees, presenting rules and giving more details about their benefits.</p>
              <p>The project was executed in HTML 5 with some animations and icons to make it lighter and more attractive to the user. To better divide the content, we created some click interactions.</p>
              <p>During this project it was possible to use the User Experience concepts on each slide, there was complete freedom to decide what kind of interaction would work better on each slide.</p>
