              <h4>GestCom App</h4>
              <p>This app is for the sales team at the store, to help them to print new price tags, check if there is no produt, check price problems reports, print offer posters and do the inventory.</p>
              <p>We started this project with a MVP, just to print the offer posters and the price tags, but as the team was using the app, they started to give us new ideas for new features to resolve the store problems.</p>
              <p>For the new features we've done design thinking workshops with the sales team, so they could help us to create the solution and they were more opened to give us feedbacks and test our prototypes.</p>
