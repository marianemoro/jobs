              <h4>Order Tracking</h4>
              <p>Leroy Merlin is a big retail company for house and construction. The company has 42 physical stores in Brazil and one e-commerce with its own products and a marketplace's products. The e-commerce team works with Agil method, so every week we have something new.</p>
              <p>As long as I was evolving my work, I started to be responsible for the whole buy flow, which starts at the product page, where the customer add to cart and then goes to cart page, checkout and order tracking.</p>
              <p>This project is an omnichannel order tracking, with this feature the customer can check the order status from the physical store and the e-commerce.</p>
              <p>With this project we decreased the customer's phone calls to ask about the order status and they could see it at this page. We've done follow up with the Customer Success area to check which new feature could be better to implement next.</p>
