              <h4>Product Page</h4>
              <p>Leroy Merlin is a big retail company for house and construction. The company has 42 physical stores in Brazil and one e-commerce with its own products and a marketplace's products. The develop team works with Agil method, so every week we have something new.</p>
              <p>I'm responsible for the whole buy flow, which starts at the product page, where the customer add the product to cart and then goes to cart page, checkout and order tracking.</p>
              <p>On this project I had the opportunity to be closer to the stakeholders from differents areas like commercial, content, SEO, developers and marketplace team. They helped me to build a new product page with strategic information for the customer.</p>
              <p>I started this project by checking the heatmap with Hotjar to understand the scroll and mouse behaviors and see where was the most interesting information for them. The next step was the benchmark, I created a spreadsheet and shared to SEO team, developers, e-commerce managers and the product team, to send me their references about which was the best element to have on a product page.</p>
              <p>This benchmark helped me to have new ideas and prepair the people to the next step, a workshop to design a new product page with draws and post-its. This kind of meeting is very important when I have so many stakeholders with so different interestings, because they can realise some information has to be down or up on the layout and then they can be more opened to these ideas.</p>
              <p>We have an update on this project and it will have modular components, where we can change the position as we need without development, and this decision will be data driven.</p>
              <p>The biggest challange here was create an environment where I could have the support from different areas with different interests.</p>
