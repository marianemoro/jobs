              <h4>Leroy Merlin Brazil - E-commerce</h4>
              <p>Leroy Merlin is a big retail company for house and construction. The company has 42 physical stores in Brazil and one e-commerce with its own products and a marketplace's products. The e-commerce team works with Agil method, so every week we have something new.</p>
              <p>I'm responsible for the whole buy flow, which starts at the product page, where the customer add to cart and then goes to cart page, checkout and order tracking.</p>
              <p>On this project I had the opportunity to be closer to the stakeholders from differents areas like commercial, content, SEO, developers and marketplace team. They helped me to build a new product page with strategic information for the customer. The newest version is a modular page, where we can change some content position when it's needed. We've done some user tests for the new features and make sure we were on the right way.</p>
              <p>I started this project by checking the heatmap with Hotjar to understand the scroll and mouse behaviors and see where was the most interesting information for them. The next step was the benchmark, I created a spreadsheet and shared to SEO team, developers, e-commerce managers and the product team, to share their best references about which was the best element to have on a product page.</p>
              <p>This benchmark helped me to new ideas and prepair the people to the next step, a workshop to design a new product page. This kind of meeting is very important when you have so many stakeholders with so different interestings, because they can realize some information has to be down or up and then they can me more opened to those ideas.</p>
              <p>We have a update on this project and the page will have modular components, where we can change the position as we need, and this decision will be data driven.</p>
              <p>The biggest challange here was create an environment where I could have the support from different areas with different interests.</p>
