              <h4>Tatos App</h4>
              <p>The app was a MVP to a fantasy sports app, where the user could create theirs own team to compete with other users.</p>
              <p>The project has started as a wireframe with another designer, just to help the investors to understand the basic userflow. So my job here at the begining was learn about football, because to test the first version  it was easier with just one kind of sport.</p>
              <p>After to understand about the sport and the basic userflow, I started to create a more complex interface, I designed the brand and the style guide to create a high fidelity prototype.</p>
              <p>This project was more about branding and user interface than user experience because I didn't have the opportunity to test with the users or have any inicial interview.</p>
