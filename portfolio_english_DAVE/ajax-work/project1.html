              <h4>Magic Seasoning Blends Marketing</h4>
              <p>Magic Seasoning Blends is a solid seasoning brand in USA, imported to Brazil since the end of 2014 by a trade company in Santa Catarina. As 100% natural formulas, gluten and preservatives free, the products are sold in major supermarket chains, expanding their business throughout the nation.</p>
              <p>The project with the client was planning the print materials to deliver in the stores and supermarkets. Different print materials were developed such as: brochure with all products, folder, recipes, magazine ad, exhibition stand and gift bag.</p>
              <p>After several meetings with the client, I realized the need to create an infographic to illustrate the statistics of the brand in Brazil and the world. This infographic is in the product brochure, and it's delivered to supermarkets and grocery stores.</p>
